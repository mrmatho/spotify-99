# Spotify '99

This is an entry for the Codedex Holiday Hackathon, imagining a world where Spotify was king of the Midi's in a world partying like it's 1999!

## Features

- Dodgy Animated GIFs
- Midi playing Smooth by Santana (very '99!)
  - Plus a cheeky easter-egg midi if you try hard enough (or look at the source code)
- Slow loading album art (I'm leaning pretty heavily on the ol' animated GIFs here)
- A guestbook to sign *Still got to get this going*
